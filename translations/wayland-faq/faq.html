<h2>Wayland FAQ</h2>

<h3>为什么要 fork X server?</h3>

<p>
  这不是 X Server 的 fork. 是一个 compositor 和它的 client 的协议而非 fork.
  compositor 把 input 事件发送给它的 client. client 在本地完成渲染,
  然后向 compositor 交换视频内存缓冲区和缓冲区需要更新的信息.
  <!--
  It's not an X server and not a fork.  It's a protocol between a
  compositor and its clients.  The compositor sends input events to
  the clients.  The clients renders locally and then communicate video
  memory buffers and information about updates to those buffers back
  to the compositor.-->
</p>

<h3>用了什么协议?</h3>

<p>
  Wayland 基于 MIT 协议发布, 而其中一些示例代码基于 GPL.
  <!-- Wayland is licensed under the MIT license with some example code
  under the GPL.-->
</p>

<h3>为什么要重复这个工程?</h3>

<p>
  Wayland 并不真的重复了太多工作. 可能时, Wayland 就重用已有的驱动和设施.
  这个项目最终可行的一个原因是 Wayland 能重用
  DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) 驱动,
  内核级 GEM (Graphics Execution Manager, 图形执行管理器) 任务(?),
  还有内核模式设置. Wayland 并不需要其他驱动的项目才能完成,
  它生长在 X.org , mesa 以及 drm 社区并从其中所有硬件实现和驱动开发中受益.
  <!--Wayland is not really duplicating much work.  Where possible,
  Wayland reuses existing drivers and infrastructure.  One of the
  reasons this project is feasible at all, is that Wayland reuses the
  DRI drivers, the kernel side GEM scheduler and kernel mode setting.
  Wayland doesn't have to compete with other projects for drivers and
  driver developers, it lives within the X.org, mesa and drm community
  and benefits from all the hardware enablement and driver development
  happening there.-->
</p>

<h3>什么是 drawing API?</h3>

<p>
  "你想它是什么就是什么, honey".  Wayland 不会代替 client 进行渲染,
  它希望 client 选用任何它们喜欢的方式渲染到可共享的缓冲区里.
  client 完成后, 会将新的内容通知给 Wayland server.
  目前测试的 client 用 cairo 的软件渲染, OpenGL 或直接硬件加速的 OpenGL 上的 cairo.
  只要你有用户空间驱动库(?)能帮你渲染到缓冲区, 你就能够去做.
  <!--"Whatever you want it to be, honey".  Wayland doesn't render on
  behalf of the clients, it expects the clients to use whatever means
  they prefer to render into a shareable buffer.  When the client is,
  it informs the Wayland server of the new contents.  The current test
  clients use either cairo software rendering, cairo on OpenGL or
  hardware accelerated OpenGL directly.  As long as you have a
  userspace driver library that will let you render into a sharable
  buffer, you're good to go.-->
</p>

<h3>Wayland 会取代 X server?</h3>

<p>
  它可以替代 X 做 Linux 原生的图形 server, 可我也确定 X 将依然存在.
  我假想 Wayland 和 X 会在 Linux 桌面以两种形式共存:
  Wayland 是一系列 X server 的图形多路复用器(?).
  目前 Linux 一般只给 GDM 和用户会话用一个 X server,
  但未来我们很可能会转移到专用的 GDM X server,
  给用户会话一个 X server (随时为更多用户的登录 spawn 更多)
  还有可能有专用于屏幕保护和解锁的 X server.
  当前我们依赖 VT 切换来在不同的 X server 之间转移, 这是可怕的.
  <!--It could replace X as the native Linux graphics server, but I'm sure
  X will always be there on the side.  I imagine that Wayland and X
  will coexist in two ways on a Linux desktop: Wayland is a graphics
  multiplexer for a number of X servers.  Linux today typically only
  uses one X server for GDM and the user session, but we'll probably
  see that move to a dedicated GDM X server, an X server for user
  sessions (spawning more on the fly as more users log in) and maybe a
  dedicated screensaver/unlock X server.  Right now we rely on VT
  switching to move between X servers, and it's horrible.  We have no
  control over what the transitions look like and the VT ioctls are
  pretty bad.  Wayland provides a solution here, in that it can host
  several X servers as they push their root window to Wayland as
  surfaces.  The compositor in this case will be a dedicated session
  switcher that will cross-fade between X servers or spin them on a
  cube.-->
</p>

<p>
  Further down the road we run a user session natively under
  Wayland with clients written for Wayland.  There will still (always)
  be X applications to run, but we now run these under a root-less X
  server that is itself a client of the Wayland server.  This will
  inject the X windows into the Wayland session as native looking
  clients.  The session Wayland server can run as a nested Wayland
  server under the system Wayland server described above, maybe even
  side by side with X sessions.  There's a number of intermediate
  steps, such as running the GNOME screen saver as a native wayland
  client, for example, or running a composited X desktop, where the
  compositor is a Wayland client, pushing the composited desktop to
  Wayland.
</p>

<h3>Why not extend the X server?</h3>

<p>
  Because for the first time we have a realistic chance of not
  having to do that.  It's entirely possible to incorporate the buffer
  exchange and update models that Wayland is built on into X.
  However, we have an option here of pushing X out of the hotpath
  between clients and the hardware and making it a compatibility
  option.  I'm not deluding myself that any general purpose desktop
  Linux distribution will stop shipping X as we know it or as a
  Wayland client anytime soon.  Nor should they, there will still be X
  applications to run and people expect that from a Linux desktop.
  What's different now is that a lot of infrastructure has moved from
  the X server into the kernel (memory management, command scheduling,
  mode setting) or libraries (cairo, pixman, freetype, fontconfig,
  pango, etc) and there is very little left that has to happen in a
  central server process.
</p>

<h3>What is wrong with X?</h3>

<p>
  The problem with X is that... it's X.  When you're an X server
  there's a tremendous amount of functionality that you must support
  to claim to speak the X protocol, yet nobody will ever use this.
  For example, core fonts; this is the original font model that was how
  your got text on the screen for the many first years of X11.  This
  includes code tables, glyph rasterization and caching, XLFDs
  (seriously, XLFDs!) Also, the entire core rendering API that lets
  you draw stippled lines, polygons, wide arcs and many more
  state-of-the-1980s style graphics primitives.  For many things we've
  been able to keep the X.org server modern by adding extension such
  as XRandR, XRender and COMPOSITE and to some extent phase out less
  useful extension.  But we can't ever get rid of the core rendering
  API and much other complexity that is rarely used in a modern
  desktop.  With Wayland we can move the X server and all its legacy
  technology to a optional code path.  Getting to a point where the X
  server is a compatibility option instead of the core rendering
  system will take a while, but we'll never get there if don't plan
  for it.
</p>

<h3>What about the overhead of running X on wayland?</h3>

<p>
  If you're running a fullscreen X server, which pushes its root
  window buffer to Wayland there is little overhead.  If the X server
  root window is transformed (i.e. scaled down or spinning on the side
  of a cube) the Wayland compositor will have to do an extra copy to
  get the pixels on screen.  But once the animation finishes and the X
  server buffer fills the entire screen, the Wayland compositor can
  change the video scanout to source from the X server buffer and
  retreat into the background.  The X server uses the standard X.org
  DDX drivers, renders to directly to its pixmaps and its root window,
  and the path from X to hardware is exactly as a native X.org server.
</p>

<h3>Is Wayland network transparent / does it support remote rendering?</h3>

<p>
  No, that is outside the scope of Wayland.  To support remote
  rendering you need to define a rendering API, which is something
  I've been very careful to avoid doing.  The reason Wayland is so
  simple and feasible at all is that I'm sidestepping this big task
  and pushing it to the clients.  It's an interesting challenge, a
  very big task and it's hard to get right, but essentially orthogonal
  to what Wayland tries to achieve.
</p>

<p>
  This doesn't mean that remote rendering won't be possible with
  Wayland, it just means that you will have to put a remote rendering
  server on top of Wayland. One such server could be the X.org server,
  but other options include an RDP server, a VNC server or somebody
  could even invent their own new remote rendering model.  Which is a
  feature when you think about it; layering X.org on top of Wayland
  has very little overhead, but the other types of remote rendering
  servers no longer requires X.org, and experimenting with new
  protocols is easier.
</p>

<p>
  It is also possible to put a remoting protocol into a wayland
  compositor, either a standalone remoting compositor or as a part of
  a full desktop compositor.  This will let us forward native Wayland
  applications.  The standalone compositor could let you log into a
  server and run an application back on your desktop.  Building the
  forwarding into the desktop compositor could let you export or share
  a window on the fly with a remote wayland compositor, for example, a
  friend's desktop.
</p>

<h3>How to download and build Wayland?</h3>

<p>
  See the <a href="building.html">build instructions</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why wasn't D-Bus used instead of the Wayland IPC mechanism?</h3>

<p>
  I wanted to preserve some important properties from the X protocol:
  the ability to queue up an event or request by just memcpy'ing into
  the protocol out-buffer.  That's what wl_connection_write does.
  Further more, it lets us memcpy several message into the buffer and
  only write it all before we go back to blocking in the main loop.
  Second, everything is explicitly asynchronous, which is a really
  powerful feature in a protocol.
</p>

<h3>How can I replace Wayland's Window Manager?</h3>

<p>
  The Wayland architecture integrates the display server, window
  manager and compositor into one process.  You can think of Wayland
  as a toolkit for creating clients and compositors. It is not a
  specific single compositor or window manager.  If you want a
  different window manager, you can write a new one.
</p>

<p>
  This may sound like a lot of work, but one of the key points about
  Wayland is that the boilerplate code to a Wayland compositor is
  comparable or less than the X boilerplate involved in becoming an X
  window manager and compositor.  Bringing up EGL and GLES2 on the
  Linux KMS framebuffer and reading input from evdev can be done in
  less that a thousand lines of code.  The Wayland server side library
  provides the protocol implementation and makes it easy to put the
  pieces together.
</p>

<h3>Why does Wayland use EGL and GLES2?</h3>

<p>
  EGL is the only GL binding API that lets us avoid dependencies on
  existing window systems, in particular X.  GLX obviously pulls in X
  dependencies and only lets us set up GL on X drawables.  The
  alternative is to write a Wayland specific GL binding API, say,
  WaylandGL.
</p>

<p>
  A more subtle point is that libGL.so includes the GLX symbols, so
  linking to that library will pull in all the X dependencies.  This
  means that we can't link to full GL without pulling in the client
  side of X, so we're using GLES2 for now.  Longer term, we'll need a
  way to use full GL under Wayland.
